##  Project Overview

This project was created as part of the **THworks assessment (Option A — React/React Native)**.  
The goal was to show understanding of:
* React component structure and state management
* Browser speech recognition integration
* Handling of user interaction through visual feedback (UI states)

---

##  Features

- Wake phrase detection (“hello”)  
- Voice command recognition using browser speech-to-text  
- Dynamic UI state transitions (idle, listening, awake, processing, result)  
- Clear visual indicators for each state  
- Timeout reset if the user doesn’t speak

#### How It Works

App always starts in `Idle` mode
Listens continuously for the word `“hello”`
When wake word is detected → switches to `Awake` mode
Captures and displays your command text in Ui
Resets automatically after a short timeout


#### Limitations

Needs internet connection (Web Speech API is cloud-based)
Wake word is basic string detection (not machine-learned)
